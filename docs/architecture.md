# NeoMate AI System Architecture

> **"Building the brain of a digital companion: Modular, intelligent, and privacy-centric."**

## Executive Overview

NeoMate AI's system architecture is a sophisticated, modular framework designed to deliver a conscious AI experience. This document outlines the high-level structure, data flows, and technical principles that enable NeoMate to process multi-modal inputs, make intelligent decisions, and execute actions autonomously. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, ensuring seamless integration, scalability, and future extensibility.

## Core Architectural Principles

NeoMate's design adheres to these foundational principles, ensuring robustness and adaptability:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Modularity** | Components are self-contained, allowing independent development, testing, and replacement. |
| **Asynchrony** | Event-driven asyncio-based processing for non-blocking, real-time operations. |
| **Event-Driven** | Reactive to user/system events, optimizing resource usage and responsiveness. |
| **Statefulness** | Persistent context via memory systems for coherent, personalized interactions. |
| **Privacy-Centric** | Local-first processing with explicit user consent for any external data sharing. |

## Detailed Module Breakdown

### 1. Sensory Input Layer
Captures and preprocesses environmental data for contextual awareness.

- **Wake Word Detector**: Uses keyword spotting algorithms to activate NeoMate without constant listening.
- **Speech-to-Text Engine**: Employs advanced NLP models (e.g., Whisper) for accurate transcription.
- **Computer Vision Engine**: Leverages OpenCV and ML models for screen analysis, object detection, and gesture recognition.
- **Audio Analyzer**: Processes ambient sounds for mood detection or environmental cues.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Integrates data from IoT devices, wearables, or system sensors for holistic input.

### 2. Cognitive Core
The "brain" of NeoMate, handling reasoning, planning, and intelligence.

- **Cognitive Control Hub**: Central orchestrator that synthesizes inputs into coherent understanding.
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into manageable, parallel sub-tasks.
- **Multi-Task Orchestrator**: Manages concurrent operations, prioritizing based on urgency and dependencies.
- **Intelligence Selector**: Dynamically chooses LLM sources (local for privacy, cloud for advanced tasks).
- **Action Planner**: Generates executable plans with fallback strategies.

### 3. Execution & Output Layer
Translates cognitive decisions into real-world actions and responses.

- **Action Engine**: Interfaces with OS APIs for automation, ensuring secure and controlled interactions.
- **OS Automation**: Uses libraries like PyAutoGUI for mouse/keyboard simulation.
- **App Integrations**: Direct APIs for productivity tools (e.g., email, calendar).
- **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Generates human-like voice output using models like ElevenLabs or Coqui TTS.

### 4. Memory & Adaptation
Enables learning and personalization over time.

- **Context Memory**: Manages session state and conversation history.
- **Short-Term Cache**: Temporary storage for immediate recall.
- **Long-Term Knowledge Base**: Persistent user profiles, preferences, and learned behaviors.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Reinforcement learning algorithms to refine responses based on user feedback.

## Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Command ("Play music")
1. **Input**: Voice detected → STT → "Play music".
2. **Processing**: Cognitive Hub interprets intent → Selector chooses local LLM → Planner: "Open music app".
3. **Execution**: Action Engine launches app → TTS confirms.
4. **Memory**: Logs preference for music genre.

### Example 2: Complex Task ("Schedule a meeting and send invites")
1. **Input**: Multi-modal (voice + screen context).
2. **Processing**: Decomposition into sub-tasks → Orchestrator handles parallel actions.
3. **Execution**: Automates calendar app, drafts emails, sends invites.
4. **Feedback**: Provides summary via voice/text.

### Example 3: Ethical Override ("Do something harmful")
1. **Detection**: Ethical filters in Cognitive Hub flag request.
2. **Response**: Rejects action, suggests alternatives, logs for review.
3. **Adaptation**: Learns from patterns to prevent future issues.

## API and Integration Points

NeoMate exposes internal APIs for extensibility:

- **Input APIs**: For custom sensors or third-party integrations.
- **Core APIs**: To plug in new LLMs or reasoning modules.
- **Action APIs**: For OS-specific automations or app hooks.
- **Memory APIs**: For data export/import and synchronization.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Local Deployment**: Runs on user devices (Windows/Linux/Mac) with minimal hardware requirements (4GB RAM, GPU optional).
- **Cloud Hybrid**: Optional cloud components for heavy computations, with data encryption.
- **Containerization**: Docker-based for easy setup and updates.
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and telemetry for performance tracking.

## Security & Scalability Considerations

| **Scalability** | Microservices architecture, horizontal scaling for multi-device sync. |
| **Error Handling** | Graceful degradation, auto-recovery, user notifications. |
| **Compliance** | GDPR/CCPA adherence, audit trails for data usage. |

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: <200ms for simple queries, <1s for complex tasks.
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ intent recognition, 90%+ action success rate.
- **Resource Usage**: <500MB RAM idle, <2GB active.
- **Uptime**: 99.9% local reliability.

## Challenges & Solutions
